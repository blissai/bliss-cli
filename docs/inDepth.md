Historical Analysis using Bliss CLI
-----------------------------------
You can also use our CLI tool to get a full historical analysis of every commit in your repository.

At a high overview, you can set this tool up on a number of 'worker' machines so that each commit is processed in parallel,
which will drastically increase the analysis time.

We recommend you connect with our support team to get the most out of this setup.
